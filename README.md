Welcome to my personal Data Structures & Algorithms repository.  
Here I’m building, implementing, and experimenting with core computer science fundamentals in **multiple programming languages**, including **C, JavaScript, Python, and Rust**.

---

## 📚 Why This Exists

- To strengthen my understanding of DSA from the ground up
- To practice multiple paradigms (procedural, functional, systems-level)
- To build a consistent, versioned body of my learning
- To share and help others learn too 💡

## 📂 Project Structure
```
DSA/
├── c/ # DSA in C (low-level, pointer-focused)
├── javascript/ # DSA in JavaScript (web-focused)
├── python/ # DSA in Python (clean, high-level)
├── rust/ # DSA in Rust (safe systems programming)
└── README.md
```


Each language contains organized folders:
- **Arrays**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Trees (Binary, AVL, etc.)**
- **Heaps**
- **Tries**
- **And more coming soon!**

---

## ✨ Current Highlights

- ✅ Trie Autocomplete Implementation (JS)
- ✅ Custom Stack, Queue, Heap (all langs)
- ✅ Hash Tables from scratch (JS, Python, Rust)
- ✅ C-style array memory management
- 🔄 More optimizations & advanced trees (e.g., AVL, B-trees) in progress...

## 🛠 Technologies Used

| Language | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| C        | Memory-level structures, performance testing |
| JavaScript | Web-based DS logic, demos, & visualization potential |
| Python   | Quick iteration, clarity, and readability |
| Rust     | Performance and safe systems-level DSA |

---

## 📌 Upcoming Plans

- [ ] Add README per language folder
- [ ] Add test cases and performance benchmarks
- [ ] Start visual demos in JavaScript
- [ ] Add graph algorithms & dynamic programming

## 💡 Final Thought

> “Learning data structures is not about memorizing code — it's about training how to think.”
